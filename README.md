#### 1.0 Introduction

###### 1.1 Problem Situation

Mental health has become an increasingly hot issue in the workplace. The mental health of employees is being negatively impacted by numerous factors within the workplace. Due to this, there is an increased strain on worker performance which is also negatively affecting company results. Currently, mental health is a stigmatized topic in the workplace. Mental health is an area of high confidentiality between employees and employers.

###### 1.2 What Is The Problem?

Approximately half of millennial workers and 75% of Gen-Zers have quit their jobs due to mental health reasons according to a survey conducted by Mind Share Partners, SAP, and Qualtrics. About 46.6 million US adults are dealing with mental illnesses, including depression and anxiety disorders. The main factors contributing to this is money, work load, and a negative working environment.

###### 1.3 Why Does It Matter?

Employee turnover has a huge cost for businesses, including rehiring, severance pay, and workplace morale. For the individual employees, this can lead to further anxiety and stress in finding a new job and explaining their situation to others. For our group, this topic is important to us because we will all be graduating at some point and joining the workforce.

###### 1.4 How Will It Be Addressed?

We will first be looking at various data sets that look at employee stress levels in the tech industry and cross check them for any common factors or answers that could potentially contribute to worker stress. We will then look for methods to mitigate the risks of mental health in the workplace and propose some solutions to provide a healthier workplace environment.

#### 5.0 Team Coordination

We plan to meet each week on Monday and Wednesday morning from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM. After discussing our goals and what we want to get out of this class, we all want to become proficient in using the R programming language and being able to create meaningful and informative data visualizations to use in our future careers. We have all agreed to using Facebook Messenger for communication. Whenever we encounter work breakdowns or communication challenges, we will make sure to address them in-person before lecture on Monday and Wednesday, and if needed, rely on our amazing TA Benji Xie for any recommendations on working through these challenges.
