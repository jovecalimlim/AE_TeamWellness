Problem Situation: Mental health is an increasing issue in the workplace. This is putting strain on worker performance and company results. Currently, mental health is stigmatized topic in the workplace. Mental health is an area of high confidentiality between employees and employers.

What Is The Problem: Half of millennial workers 75% of Gen-Zers have quit their jobs due to mental health reasons. About 46.6 million US adults are dealing with mental illnesses, including depression and anxiety disorders. The main factors contributing to this is money, work load, and a negative working environment.

Why Does It Matter: Employee turnover has a huge cost for businesses, including rehiring, severance pay, and workplace morale. For the individual employees, this can lead to further anxiety and stress in finding a new job and explaining their situation to others. For our group, this topic is important to us because we will all be graduating at some point and joining the workforce.

How Will It Be Addressed: We will first be looking at a data set that looks at employee stress levels in the tech industry. We will then look for methods to mitigate the risks of mental health in the workplace and propose some solutions to provide a healthier workplace environment.

Research Questions:

What is the biggest driver of mental illness in the workplace?
Whatâ€™s the most common mental health issue among workers?
